"""Strategy approval registry contract — Wave-04.6 PR-D.

The :class:`StrategyRegistry` is the **governance-side** view of every
trading strategy ever proposed by Indira's composition engine. It is
orthogonal to the intelligence-side
:class:`intelligence_engine.strategy_runtime.StrategyStateMachine`
which tracks deployment-tier promotions
(``PROPOSED → SHADOW → CANARY → LIVE``). The registry asks a different
question: *"is this strategy approved for use at all?"*

Lifecycle::

    DRAFT  ─┐
            ├──► VALIDATING ─┬─► APPROVED ─► RETIRED
            └────────────────┴────────────► RETIRED  (validation failed
                                                       or operator
                                                       withdrew)

Both terminal states (``APPROVED``→``RETIRED``,
``VALIDATING``→``RETIRED``) are reachable; only ``RETIRED`` is final.

Determinism (INV-15 / TEST-01): every transition is materialised as a
``STRATEGY_LIFECYCLE`` row in the authority ledger so the registry can
be replayed bit-identically by walking the chain.

The contract module is **pure** — no IO, no state, no clocks. The
governance-engine adapter
(``governance_engine.strategy_registry``) owns the in-memory dictionary,
the ledger writer, and the replay loop.
